# PROYECTO_GAMEZONE

## Overview
This is a mobile development project (desarrollo móvil) imported from GitHub. Currently, the repository contains only a README file with no application code yet.

## Project Status
- **Type**: Mobile Development Project (not yet implemented)
- **Current State**: Empty repository with only README
- **Original Repository**: https://github.com/mr-benju/PROYECTO_GAMEZONE

## Next Steps
Since this is an empty project, you'll need to:
1. Choose your mobile development framework (React Native, Flutter, Ionic, etc.)
2. Add the application code
3. Configure the development environment

Once you add code to this project, I can help set up the proper development workflow and configuration.
